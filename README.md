# ADC-VALUE-PRINT-PIC16F877A

### DESCRIPTION
 Assembly project that can read Analog input through ADC and print it on to the LCD display 

 Analog chanel uses 10-bit value and pair of 8-bit registers are used, I have written a algorithem in ASSEMBLY to convert this register pair values into a character.
